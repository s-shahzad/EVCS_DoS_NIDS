# Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack Detection for EV Charging Station Networks

## üìñ Description
This project presents a supervised Machine Learning model developed to detect and classify Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station networks. As the adoption of EVs grows, securing the underlying smart grid infrastructure is critical. This Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) aims to provide a robust solution for identifying malicious traffic patterns and enhancing the security of EV charging ecosystems.

## ‚ú® Key Features
* Developed a supervised machine learning model using **Python** and **Scikit-learn**.
* Trained and evaluated the model on a specialized dataset, achieving **over 90% detection accuracy**.
* Analyzes network traffic patterns and attack signatures to accurately classify threats.
* Provides a foundation for a real-time NIDS to be deployed in smart grid infrastructures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
*(Please add or remove any libraries as needed)*

## üöÄ How to Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/s-shahzad/EVCS_DoS_NIDS.git](https://github.com/s-shahzad/EVCS_DoS_NIDS.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd EVCS_DoS_NIDS
    ```
3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the main script:**
    ```bash
    python your_main_script_name.py 
    ```
    *(Make sure to replace `your_main_script_name.py` with the actual name of your main file)*

## üìà Evaluation
The model was evaluated based on its classification performance, achieving an overall accuracy of over 90%. Key metrics such as precision, recall, and the F1-score were used to assess its effectiveness in distinguishing between benign traffic and DoS attacks.
